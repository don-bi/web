      Items are an essential part in winning a match. Every item has their own build paths, where smaller component items could be bought and used while waiting to combine into a much better item later. Each unique item provides their users different stats, whether it's maximum hp, resistances, attack damage, ability power, movement speed, or more. Along with just basic stats, some larger items grant passive buffs or active skills that could be used to a player's advantage. Every item that you have over the enemy is important for beating them in lane or in the jungle early, even if it's just a basic steel longsword.

      <h2>Classification</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Each item is categorized into five tiers, excluding consumables and boots which have no categorization. These tiers include: Starter, Basic, Epic, Legendary, Mythic.
    </p>

    <h3>Starter Items</h3>

    <p>
      Starter items are what players usually start the game with. They grant high stats for their value, but do not build into any higher tier items. They're usually kept in the inventory until mid-game, where players start selling them to purchase more important items.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Items</h3>

    <p>
      Basic items are lesser items that usually don't cost much gold. They grant a single stat increase or effect and are usually components for several epic or legendary items.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Epic Items</h3>

    <p>
      Epic items provide either more stat increases than basic items or have a special effect that usually corresponds to what they build into. Most epic items usually have one or more basic items as a component, and build into higher tier legendary and mythic items.

    <h3>Legendary Items</h3>

    <p>
      Legendary items are the final build paths of items along with mythic items. They hold the highest stat boosts and each have unique abilities either passive or active. All legendary items have components of either basic or epic items. Some legendary item effects include, but are not limited to: executing enemies below a certain hp threshold, giving the user an aura that slows enemies' attack speeds, providing a shield to block spells, and charging up to deal bonus damage after fully charged.

    <h3>Mythic Items</h3>

    <p>
      Like legendary items, mythic items are the final build paths. However, each player can only own one mythic item. Each unique mythic item contain strong abilities that are useful in different situations. Mythic items are usually built first since they grant the user stat boosts for every legendary item they own, such as giving 5% bonus magic penetration for each legendary item. Champions usually hit a powerspike upon completing their mythic items since they grant buffs that allow them to dominate the enemy if they haven't completed their mythic item yet.

      <h2>Ornn Upgrades</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Ornn, the Fire below the Mountain, is a champion who has a passive that allows him to upgrade his own and his teamates' items. The items he can upgrade are all mythic items and once upgraded, they give greater stat boosts but have no changes towards their special abilities.
