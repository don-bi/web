      In League of Legends, there are five main roles someone can choose to play as, each with their own unique responsibilities and playstyles. These roles are the top laner, the jungler, the mid laner, the adc, and the support. The name of these roles correspond to the area of the map Summoners Rift of where the players are located for the beginning of the game in what we call "laning phase".

      Top
    </h3>

    <p>
      The top lane is the longest lane in the game along with having three bushes. Due to its distance covered, top laners usually play champions that have 1v1 superiority such as bruisers, duelists, and tanks. If one player gets ahead in the lane, it will be difficult to come back due to the lane length preventing the players that's behind from walking up too far to get resources. The top laner's goal is usually to win their own matchup and use their lead to help other parts of the map get ahead.

      Jungler
    </h3>

    <p>
      Junglers have the most freedom within the rift. The areas in between the lanes without protection from the turrets is called the jungle. Instead of killing minions to gain gold and experience, junglers have to kill monster camps. This role requires the most decision making out of every role since they have a large amount of control in how events play out in every part of the map. This also means that junglers will have the most impact in the game since their actions can affect every other laner. Their main obective is to do surprise attacks on laners called 'ganks' in order to get their own teammates ahead.

      Mid
    </h3>

    <p>
      Mid laners sit in the center of the whole map, which gives them a large amount of impact in other lanes. Champions that can traverse the rift fast and roam around are usually played in the mid lane along with mages who have attacks with long ranges and area of affect. Helping the jungler whenever a skirmish occurs is a large part in getting the team ahead as a mid laner. Roaming around to the top and bottom lanes can also help get free kills to get themselves ahead.

      Adc/Bottom
    </h3>

    <p>
      Adc, or attack damage carry, are usually played by marksmen champions. Their goal is to carry teamfights with insane DPS and to farm minions for gold to buy enough items for their powerspikes. These are the players that are most crucial in protecting so they can dish out damage onto the enemy team. They sit in the bottom lane with a support to provide them help and safety during laning phase.

      Support
    </h3>

    <p>
      The support's role is to help the team by either providing heals and shields in the back or commencing the fight through a strong engage. They sit in the bottom lane with the adc early game in order to give opportunities for kills or protecting their own adc from the enemy team's threats. If there's a period of time where the adc is safe without them, supports are able to roam aroudn the map and provide assistance to other laners, mainly the jungler.
