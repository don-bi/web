      <h2>Classes</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      There are 154 champions, which are playable characters, in League of Legends currently. Each champion has their own respective playstyle and functions differently in their kits. Players have classified this ocean of champions into classes that correspond to what they do best. A few of these classes are assassins, bruisers, marksmen, tanks, and control mages. There are much more than just these five, but these are some of the most common picks.

      Assassins
    </h3>

    <p>
      Assassins are one of the most mobile classes in League in order to quickly reach the back line damage dealers of the enemy team. They have abilities with high burst damage to pop a damage carry and quickly retreat into the fog of war. Assassins are usually played in the mid lane and jungle, where they have the option to roam around the map and look for easy targets.

      Bruisers
    </h3>

    <p>
      A combination of tankiness and consistent high damage output. Brusiers are the juggernauts that have large base stats of hp and resistances, along with kits that output crazy amounts of damage. Bruisers usually have abilities that grant healing so they can sustain longer in teamfights or in lane. They're usually played in the top lane, where they can dominate the opponent.

      Marksmen
    </h3>

    <p>
      Marksmen are long range damage dealers usually carrying a ranged weapon. Instead of using their abilities to do damage, most of their damage output comes from their basic auto attacks. They usually build a ton of attack speed and critical chance to maximize their DPS. Marksmen are usually incredibly squishy, meaning they have a small health pool, and require other teammates to defend them. They're usually played in the adc role.

      Tanks
    </h3>

    <p>
      Basically the same as what they are in every other game. A tank's role is to soak up damage and create engages for their own team. They build items with a ton of resistances and health to survive incoming attacks from the enemy team. Since they won't be building damage stats, their abilities usually have high base damages so they can still pose a threat to unsuspecting opponents. Tanks are usually played in the top lane or as a support.

      Control Mages
    </h3>

    <p>
      Having abilities with long ranges, control mages specialize in zoning the enemy from crucial positions and dishing out consistent damage through their abilities from far distances. Control mages rely on magic damage through abilities to deal damage and they don't do much damage through basic attacks. Mana is a necessity for them, having them require resource mangement. Control mages usually have many crowd control or immobilizing abilities to catch out of position enemies. They're usually played in the mid lane.
